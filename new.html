          Been less than a month now <br />since i met you
          ah well first of all very happy birthday Jasmine you fiinally turn 17
          Hope you'll hold up well with every thing around you
          say was i a good person in yout eyes?
          i'll be honest u were the greatest person i ever witnessed...
          you know u came into my life as a sun tearing through a dark cloudy sky 
          i know am childish asf to say this but i fell for you and how was i certain of that ?
          Anything i read, anything i saw remotely close to the word love reminnded me of u
          from dreams to every waking hour i saw nothin but u 
          the only thing i talked to anyone was how this one person stole my heart with 0 effort
          yeah am not remotely close to the sort of guys you prefer but even then i wanted to be somene you trusted with everythin
          i wanted you to teach me how to live
          for no matter what you faced you still came out on top that always mesmerized me
          you were the light in sky that bloomed the brightest to me
          you are my anti depressants
          farewell
          a light i'll never hold
